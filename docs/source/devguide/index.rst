Welcome to the OpenMOC Developer's Guide! The Developer's Guide is a **must read** for those planning to contribute new code features to the OpenMOC open source project. This guide documents and explains the structure and design of the OpenMOC source code. The Guide discusses how SWIG is used to couple compiled C/C++ source code into a Python interface. In addition, the Python build system and techniques for debugging OpenMOC are presented. The Guide concludes with an overview of the coding style and development workflow used by the OpenMOC development team.

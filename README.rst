PINSPEC Monte Carlo Particle Transport Code
==========================================

The PINSPEC project project aims to provide a simple-to-use 
Python package for spectral calculations of nuclear reactor 
applications. It includes support for infinite homogeneous
spectral calculations, heterogeneous-homogeneous pin cell
equivalence calculations, as well as constructive solid
geometry and 3D ray tracing for fully heterogeneous
calculations. A basic ENDF-VII continuous energy 
cross-section is provided with support for the user to
make additions to the library for their own applications.
The project started under the Computational Reactor Physics 
Group at MIT.

Complete documentation on the usage of PINSPEC is hosted on 
our GitHub wiki at https://github.com/mit-crpg/PINSPEC/wiki. 
If you are interested in the project or would like to help and 
contribute, please contact the development team. In addition, 
PINSPEC hosts a collection of publicly readable `Evernote notebooks`_ 
to allow for free and open collaboration between users and the 
development team. If you plan to use PINSPEC frequently and would 
like to contribute notes and feedback through Evernote, please 
`contact`_ the development team.

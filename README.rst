Welcome to the OpenMOC repository! OpenMOC is a simulation tool for
solving for the flux, power distribution, and multiplication factor
within a nuclear reactor. The code employs the deterministic method
of characteristics, with support for both fixed source and eigenvalue
calculations. The OpenMOC project aims to provide a simple-to-use
Python package bound to a back-end of source code written in C/C++
and CUDA. It includes support for constructive solid geometry and 2D
ray tracing for fully heterogeneous multi-group calculations.
Development of OpenMOC began at MIT in 2012 and is spearheaded by
several graduate students in the
`Nuclear Science & Engineering Department`_.

Complete documentation on OpenMOC is hosted at
https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/. If you would like to
contribute to the OpenMOC project, please `contact`_ the
development team.

For a guided example, see a demonstration `IPython Notebook`_.
